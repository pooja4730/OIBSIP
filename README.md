Projects completed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte using Python and Google Colab.

# Oasis Infobyte Internship Projects
This repository contains the projects completed by me as part of my internship at **Oasis Infobyte**.  
All projects were developed using **Python** and executed in **Google Colab**.

- Technologies used: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib / Scikit-learn

## Projects Included
Worked on multiple data analysis and machine learning projects using Python and Google Colab, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

### 1. Problem01.ipynb (EDA on Retail Sales Data)
- Performed exploratory data analysis to identify sales trends, patterns, and customer purchasing behavior using Python.
- 
### 2. Problem02.ipynb (Customer Segmentation)
- Analyzed customer data and applied clustering techniques to group customers based on purchasing patterns.

### 3. Problem03.ipynb (Sentiment Analysis)
– Built a model to analyze and classify textual reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

### 4. Problem04.ipynb (Data Cleaning) 
– Processed raw datasets by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies to prepare data for analysis.

### 5. Problem05.ipynb (House Price Prediction (Linear Regression) )
– Implemented a regression model to predict housing prices based on property features.

### 6. Problem06.ipynb (Wine Quality Prediction)
– Developed a machine learning model to classify wine quality using physicochemical attributes.

### 7. Problem07.ipynb (Fraud Detection) 
– Applied classification techniques to identify potentially fraudulent transactions in datasets.

### 8. Problem08.ipynb (Android App Market Analysis)
– Explored Google Play Store data to analyze app categories, ratings, installs, and market trends.

All projects were implemented using Python in Google Colab, demonstrating fundamental programming concepts, data manipulation, and analytical techniques.
